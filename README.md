# Biometric-Attendance-Management-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi
A system that allows marking attendance by matching MD5-Hash keys of images and provides CSV files for easy transfer.<br>
A simple client-side system to take attendane and add students to a roll call. Designed to be a biometric-attendance system. A decent web-UI but the image matching is really minimalistic. Only same images generate same MD5's, so need some approximation measure. Not Implemented.

This is a user friendly website to monitor attendance of students in a college. The website is based on PHP,CSS and javascript. It works on local host.

FEATURES:
Data has been managed using MYSQLdatabase.
It consists of interactive web pages.
Uses NODE MCU, Finger print sensor R307, Power supply, Wi-fi source.
Fingerprint is matched with existing database and attendance is marked on successful matching of fingerprint
